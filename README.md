# Advent of Code 2018

Advent of code 2018 solutions in Python, and some in Nim. I started out using only Nim, but was disillusioned by the poor performance after a couple of days, and switched to only Python.

I started learning Nim on the first day of the event, so don't expect anything too amazing. I put my observations in each day's directory, if there is anything interesting to note.
